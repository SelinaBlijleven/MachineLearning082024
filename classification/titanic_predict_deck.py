titanic_predict_deck.py

During the titanic exercise, we found that the missing deck values were hard to handle.
This script will attempt to predict the deck values.

On the results: most classifiers have a weak performance on this task, generally
confusing the decks right above and below the target deck with the target.
Best results so far seem to come from the RandomForest, which might benefit from fine-tuning.

However, if we analyse the Titanic dataset and its properties, we don't seem to have enough
information to predict this. We do have the 'class' column, which is more generalized than the deck column.
This column Ã­s in fact complete and is perhaps better to use for our prediction.
